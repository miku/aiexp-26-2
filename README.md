## Open Discussion

* models differences mostly stem from their [post-training](https://tokens-for-thoughts.notion.site/post-training-101)
* models are mostly [just files](https://github.com/miku/localai-kith-2025?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-an-open-model), despite their seemingly interactive nature
* nobel laureate [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) says models [confabulate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LAdPHiymUhg) (not hallucinate)
* closed and open models
* open models can run on your laptop or PC
* [Jan.ai](https://www.jan.ai/) and [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) are two of the many (desktop) applications to run local models; there are by now, [many of those](https://github.com/miku/localai-kith-2025?tab=readme-ov-file#list-of-popular-open-weights-models)

* system prompts allow to adjust the "persona" of a model

Training different interaction modes:

* "thinking", which is mostly additional token generation to fill the context;
  also called "test-time compute" (vs train-time compute), "more tokens improve
  model performance"
* "tool use", match prompt against a registered set of tools





## Updates

* [How AI Destroys Institutions](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-ai-destroys-institutions/)

> AI systems are built to function in ways that degrade and are likely to
> destroy our crucial civic institutions. The affordances of AI systems have
> the effect of eroding expertise, short-circuiting decision-making, and
> isolating people from each other.
